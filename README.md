# MakeEssence
A simple script to automate the purchase of the 1 token Blue Essence reward from the League of Legends Event Store. Often we are left with less than 10 tokens for an event store, which can only be redeemed for the 1 token Blue Essence reward. To redeem each reward requires quite a few tedious steps that must be done for each token. This script uses PyAutoGUI to automate the process through the front-end using only on screen images.

To use: update the shop.png file in the assets folder with a screenshot of the latest shop title (use the file in the assets folder already as a reference).
